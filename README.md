## DB/Login deliverable
For this deliverable I associate posts with users, added a create user function, a login function, and a post function. This is all stored in the database and displayed dynamically on my website. 
- **MongoDB Atlas database created** - done!
- **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!
- **User registration** - Users can create a new account and are required to enter in all information. This is stored in my MangoDB database.
- **existing user** - Stores information of existing user. User can make posts and view posts. Posts contain user data. 
- **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both users and posts. The database is secure because the passwords are encoded.
- **Restricts functionality** - You cannot post without being logged in. I added a token and cookie so you can't just add a username to ti localstorage.
